## Title: Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies

Ransomware has evolved from simple file-locking malware to complex, multi-stage attacks that cause billions of dollars in damage each year. This project studies how ransomware has changed and tests modern defense tools that can detect or stop these attacks. Using a virtual lab built with **Metasploitable**, **Metasploit**, and **Wireshark**, I will simulate ransomware-like activity to observe how it behaves on a system. Then I will test open-source tools like **Raccine** and **Velociraptor** to measure how quickly and accurately they detect malicious behavior. The research portion will analyze major ransomware trends from 2010–2025 and review case studies from industry reports. The goal is to identify which detection methods work best *before* encryption starts and what organizations can do to reduce damage. The final outcome will be a combined research + practical testing report highlighting the most reliable defense approaches against modern ransomware.

## Self-Evaluation

My abstract includes all five required parts: background, problem statement, purpose, methods, and expected results. It clearly states what I’m doing and why it matters. I used specific tools (Metasploit, Raccine, Velociraptor) to keep the plan concrete. The hardest part was keeping it concise while describing both research and hands-on work. The abstract aligns with my feasibility analysis and presents an ambitious but realistic semester project.
