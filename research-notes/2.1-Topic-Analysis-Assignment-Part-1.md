## Topic 1: Ransomware Evolution and Defense Strategies

**Initial Interest Level (1–10):** 10  

I chose ransomware because it is one of the biggest cybersecurity threats today. Attacks like **Colonial Pipeline**, **WannaCry**, and **JBS Meatpacking** show how much damage ransomware can do to businesses and even entire countries. This makes the topic both interesting and important.

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Resources/Tools Needed:** Research papers, news reports, case studies from FBI/CISA, and possibly safe lab tools like virtual machines to study ransomware behavior.  
- **Current Knowledge Level:** I know the basics — ransomware encrypts files and demands payment. I also know about some famous cases.  
- **What I Need to Learn:** The details of how ransomware groups operate, how they break into systems, and the latest defense strategies like zero-trust security, segmentation, and advanced backups.

### Project vs Research Classification
This will be **research-based**. I will study real-world cases and write a research paper about how ransomware has evolved and how we can defend against it.

- **Main Deliverable:** A research paper with case studies, analysis, and recommended defenses.

### Real-World Application
Ransomware is a real and growing problem. Businesses, hospitals, and even governments are being attacked. My research will explain how to stop these attacks or reduce the damage. This helps the industry by improving security awareness and defense planning.

### Potential Career Connection
This topic prepares me for jobs in cybersecurity defense and digital forensics. I will build skills in threat analysis, understanding malware tactics, and writing professional security reports. These are valuable skills for working in IT security, law enforcement, or private companies.

## Topic 2: IoT Device Security and Government Surveillance Risks

**Initial Interest Level (1–10):** 9  

I chose IoT security because smart devices are everywhere: phones, cameras, TVs, even cars. **Edward Snowden**, a former NSA contractor and systems administrator, revealed how governments can use technology to spy on citizens, and IoT makes that even easier. This is both fascinating and concerning, so I want to study it.

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Resources/Tools Needed:** Snowden’s reports, WikiLeaks “Vault 7” info, IoT security research, and maybe basic tools like Shodan or Wireshark to see how exposed IoT devices are.  
- **Current Knowledge Level:** I know IoT devices often have weak security and can be hacked. I’ve also read about smart TVs and Alexa devices being misused for spying.  
- **What I Need to Learn:** Specific IoT vulnerabilities, encryption methods, and how governments use IoT data for surveillance. Also how to protect against it with both technical fixes and policy changes.

### Project vs Research Classification
This will also be **research-based**, though I may include small demonstrations of IoT risks.

- **Main Deliverable:** A research paper analyzing IoT surveillance risks and solutions.

### Real-World Application
IoT devices are now part of everyday life. If they are not secure, hackers and even governments can spy on people. This research matters because it shows how to defend privacy and keep IoT safe in homes, businesses, and critical systems.

### Potential Career Connection
This topic connects to careers in digital forensics, network defense, and cybersecurity policy. I will develop skills in analyzing IoT threats, understanding privacy laws, and recommending defenses. These skills are valuable for jobs in both technical and policy sides of cybersecurity.
