## Part A â€“ Comprehensive Topic Analysis  

### ðŸ§© Topic: Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies  

#### 1. Feasibility Assessment  
For this project, Iâ€™ll focus on studying how ransomware attacks have changed over time and how different defense tools can detect or stop them early. Iâ€™ll use a **virtual lab setup** with **Metasploitable**, **Metasploit**, **Nmap**, and **Wireshark**, since we already use these in class and theyâ€™re safe for controlled testing. Iâ€™ll also explore open-source tools like **Raccine** and **Velociraptor**, which are designed for early detection and response.  

My current skill level is around **3/5**. Iâ€™m confident setting up VMs and scanning networks, but Iâ€™ll need to learn more about malware behavior and system monitoring.  

I have access to all needed tools, research papers, and online resources. The main thing Iâ€™ll need to study more is how ransomware encrypts data, how to analyze logs, and how defense tools react to those attacks. Everything can be done inside a virtual environment, which keeps it safe and realistic for an **8â€“10 week project**.  

##### ðŸ”¹ For Project-Based Topics  
Iâ€™ll simulate ransomware-like activity in my virtual machines and test how defensive tools respond. My environment will use VirtualBox with Windows and Linux VMs, plus monitoring tools like Wireshark. The project is realistic within 8â€“10 weeks if I focus on data collection, analysis, and comparison instead of building a large tool from scratch.  

##### ðŸ”¹ For Research-Based Topics  
The research side will include case studies, academic articles, and cybersecurity reports on how ransomware has evolved since 2010 â€” especially the rise of **double-extortion** and **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)**. Iâ€™ll compare how older detection methods differ from newer behavioral and AI-based ones. Iâ€™ll also include real data from **Chainalysis** and **Sophos** reports to show the scale of ransomwareâ€™s growth.  

---

#### 2. Learning and Growth Potential  
This topic will help me grow both **technically and analytically**. Technically, Iâ€™ll learn more about malware behavior, digital forensics, and system monitoring. Iâ€™ll also gain **hands-on experience** using tools that professionals in incident response use.  

On the research side, Iâ€™ll learn how to combine technical testing with real-world data to find trends and conclusions.  

The biggest challenge will be safely running simulations and making sure I donâ€™t accidentally harm my system. But Iâ€™m excited about it because ransomware is one of the most serious threats today, and understanding how it works is a major step toward becoming a cybersecurity professional.  

This connects directly to my **career goal** of working in **digital forensics or incident response**.

#### 3. Realistic Planning  

| **Goal Level** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Ambitious Goal** | Create a small Python or PowerShell script that can detect or flag suspicious file encryption behavior inside a VM. |
| **Realistic Target** | Simulate ransomware behavior in my virtual lab and compare how tools like Raccine and Velociraptor respond. |
| **Minimum Outcome** | Write a complete research paper explaining how ransomware evolved and what defense strategies are most effective today. |

## Part B â€“ Simple Comparison  

| **Criteria** | **Topic 1: Government Surveillance** | **Topic 2: Ransomware Defense** |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Feasibility / Accessibility** | 3 | 5 |
| **Personal Interest** | 4 | 5 |
| **Learning Potential** | 4 | 5 |
| **Career Relevance** | 3 | 5 |
| **Total Score** | **14 / 20** | **20 / 20** |

### ðŸ§  Summary  
Both topics are interesting, but ransomware fits better for me right now. Itâ€™s hands-on, technical, and directly tied to my career path.  

The government surveillance topic would definitely be exciting because I like exposing the truth and questioning whatâ€™s really happening behind the scenes â€” but the problem is thereâ€™s not enough solid evidence out there to fully support my claims without it sounding like a conspiracy theory.  

Thatâ€™s why I decided to go with **ransomware** instead. Itâ€™s something I can actually test, measure, and back up with real data, while still learning the same investigative mindset that first got me interested in cybersecurity.  

---

## Part C â€“ Final Topic Selection  

### 1. Final Choice  
I chose **Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies** for my final capstone topic.  

In this project, Iâ€™ll research how ransomware has developed over the years and what defense tools are most effective at stopping it. Iâ€™ll use a virtual lab setup with **Metasploitable**, **Metasploit**, **Nmap**, and **Wireshark** to simulate attack activity safely.  

Iâ€™ll also test open-source detection tools like **Raccine** and **Velociraptor** to see how they respond to simulated ransomware behavior.  

---

### 2. Why This Topic  
This topic is both **achievable and challenging**. Itâ€™s achievable because I already know how to set up virtual machines and use tools like Metasploit, but itâ€™s challenging enough to push me to learn more about malware detection and forensic analysis.  

Itâ€™s meaningful because ransomware affects real people, companies, and even hospitals. Every year it causes billions of dollars in losses, and defenders are constantly trying to stay one step ahead.  

Working on this topic gives me a chance to understand how those defenses work and maybe even come up with new ideas for improvement.  

This project balances feasibility and growth perfectly and lines up with my long-term goal of working in **incident response** or **digital forensics**.  

---

### 3. Three-Tier Plan  

- **Ambitious Goal:** Build a simple script that can detect suspicious ransomware-like file encryption behavior and log it in real time.  
- **Realistic Target:** Use my virtual lab to simulate ransomware and measure how tools like Raccine and Velociraptor detect or stop it.  
- **Minimum Viable Outcome:** Write a full report on how ransomware has evolved and which defense strategies are most effective according to current research and my testing.  

---

### 4. The Learning Value  
This topic will teach me how to safely test and analyze malware behavior in a lab, how detection tools work, and how to document cybersecurity experiments.  

Even if I donâ€™t complete every part, Iâ€™ll still gain valuable experience in **threat detection, analysis, and response** â€” real-world skills that will help me in my cybersecurity career.  

Attempting something ambitious like this shows Iâ€™m serious about learning and ready to take on challenges that matter in the real world.
