## Topic 1: Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies

### GitHub Project 1: Raccine  
- **Citation:** Neo23x0. (2025). *Raccine — A Simple Ransomware Vaccine.* GitHub. [https://github.com/Neo23x0/Raccine](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Raccine)  
- **Type:** Security Tool  
- **Synopsis:**  
  Raccine is a Windows tool that tries to stop ransomware before it can delete backups. It looks for dangerous commands like `delete shadows` and kills the program that is trying to run them. It’s very lightweight and doesn’t need an agent, which makes it easy to test.  
  The downside is that it hasn’t been updated recently, and sometimes it interferes with backup software.  
  **Stats:** ~969 stars, 125 forks.  
- **Relevance:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4/5)  
  Shows a clear way to block part of a ransomware attack, but it’s not a full solution.

### GitHub Project 2: Velociraptor  
- **Citation:** Velocidex. (2025). *Velociraptor — Endpoint Visibility and DFIR Collection.* GitHub. [https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor)  
- **Type:** DFIR Tool (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)  
- **Synopsis:**  
  Velociraptor is a large, powerful tool for investigating and responding to incidents like ransomware. It allows investigators to collect evidence from many computers at once, check for suspicious files, and trace attacker movements across a network.  
  It runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, has excellent documentation, and continues to be updated.  
  **Stats:** ~3.5k stars, 555 forks.  
- **Relevance:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)  
  Highly relevant because it focuses on the response phase of ransomware defense and incident handling.

## Topic 2: IoT Device Security & Government Surveillance Risks

### GitHub Project 1: IoTGoat  
- **Citation:** OWASP. (2025). *IoTGoat — Deliberately Insecure IoT Firmware (OpenWrt).* GitHub. [https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat](https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat)  
- **Type:** Educational Repository  
- **Synopsis:**  
  IoTGoat is an intentionally vulnerable IoT firmware designed for learning and experimentation. It simulates an insecure IoT device based on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, allowing students and researchers to practice attacking and securing systems safely.  
  **Stats:** ~816 stars, 144 forks.  
- **Relevance:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)  
  Extremely relevant because it directly supports learning about IoT vulnerabilities and defenses in a controlled environment.

### GitHub Project 2: RouterSploit  
- **Citation:** threat9. (2025). *RouterSploit — Exploitation Framework for Embedded Devices.* GitHub. [https://github.com/threat9/routersploit](https://github.com/threat9/routersploit)  
- **Type:** Security Tool / Exploitation Framework  
- **Synopsis:**  
  RouterSploit functions like Metasploit but focuses on routers and IoT devices. It includes modules for scanning, exploitation, and password testing across various brands of hardware. The tool demonstrates real-world IoT security weaknesses effectively, although development has slowed in recent years.  
  **Stats:** ~12.8k stars, 2.4k forks.  
- **Relevance:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4/5)  
  Shows the offensive side of IoT insecurity — useful for demonstrations but not always up to date.

## Comparison Notes

### Ransomware Tools
- **Raccine** focuses on **prevention**, stopping ransomware behavior before encryption occurs.  
- **Velociraptor** focuses on **response and investigation** after an attack.  
Together, they illustrate both **proactive and reactive** defense strategies.

### IoT Security Tools
- **IoTGoat** serves as a **safe training ground** for testing IoT vulnerabilities.  
- **RouterSploit** represents the **offensive side**, showing how attackers exploit devices.  
Using both tools provides a full understanding of the IoT security landscape — from learning to defense to exploitation.
