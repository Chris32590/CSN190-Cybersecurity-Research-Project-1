Reflection Response
As I work toward completing my Associate Degree in Cybersecurity, my immediate career goal is to enter the workforce after graduation. Gaining hands-on industry experience will allow me to apply the technical knowledge I have developed in networking, scripting and security fundamentals. While I do plan to pursue a master’s degree in the future, I believe building professional experience first will strengthen my resume and make me more competitive when I transfer to a four year program.

Based on the cybersecurity roadmap and skills assessment video, I already have several strengths. My background in networking and scripting provides a strong foundation for understanding security operations. I also have experience with vulnerability scanning and system hardening, along with the ability to document and communicate findings effectively. These skills give me the confidence to take on entry level roles where attention to detail and problem solving are essential.

At the same time, I recognize several gaps that I need to address. I need more exposure to Security Operations Center (SOC) processes such as log analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. I also want to strengthen my familiarity with frameworks like NIST 800-61 and improve my technical skills with tools such as Splunk, Wireshark, and vulnerability management platforms. Earning certifications, especially CompTIA Security+, is another major step that will improve my employability.

This CSN 190 research project will help me close these gaps by pushing me to explore industry resources and apply my knowledge in more practical ways. By engaging with professional content, completing labs, and documenting my work, I can begin creating a portfolio that demonstrates my technical ability. The project also encourages me to connect academic learning with real-world industry expectations, which directly supports my career development.

This semester, I plan to dedicate at least two hours per day to career readiness. My first step is preparing for the Security+ exam. I will also complete one vulnerability management course and at least two SOC-related courses, each resulting in a documented project. In addition, I will update my résumé and LinkedIn profile and begin applying for internships by the end of the semester. These steps will ensure I graduate with both practical skills and professional readiness.
